# CityBuilder

This is me fooling around with
 1. creating meshes dynamically. I'm currently experiencing problems with the bump & height maps: the sides don't seem to be bumped at all
 2. using bump, height, specular and other maps in my materials
 3. using the normal distribution to create higher buildings in the centre of the town
 4. failing to use Perlin noise (there's a loop in the recursion)
